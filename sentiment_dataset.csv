790,When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1
791,Once your food arrives it's meh.,0
792,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
793,The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.,1
794,"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.",0

805,"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.",0
806,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1
807,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0
808,"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",1
809,"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.",1

831,Very poor service.,0
832,No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,0
833,"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1
834,They were excellent.,1
835,I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
836,Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1
837,I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0
838,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
839,I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!,1
840,"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.",0

848,"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.",0
849,"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!",0
850,the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
851,I probably would not go here again.,0
852,So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,1
853,The price is reasonable and the service is great.,1
854,"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",0
855,My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
856,"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.",1
857,Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,1
858,I probably won't be coming back here.,0
859,Worst food/service I've had in a while.,0
860,"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.",1
861,Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,1

868,"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.",1

870,"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.",0
871,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0

881,"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.",0
882,We definately enjoyed ourselves.,1
883,I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,0
884,"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.",0
885,I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
886,The service was extremely slow.,0
887,"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.",0

904,#NAME?,0
905,"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0

983,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
984,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.",0
985,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
986,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
